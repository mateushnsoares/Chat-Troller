# Chat Troller

A simpre Python program that reads all the content of a certain file, and sends an individual message for every word to a WhatsApp Web chat.\
I have already included the Shrek script and Never Gonna Give You Up lyrics on this project as some troll file templates.

**Only tested on Whatsapp Web (on Google Chrome) using a Windows 10 computer with a 1920x1080 panel.**

### I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THIS CODE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

To use the program, change the 'chatName' variable (line 17) to the WhatsApp chat you want to troll, then run `ChatTroller.py`. Be sure to already be logged in on the web browser being used.

This code can be easily modified to work on other messaging apps (such as Discord or Telegram).\
To get your own coordinates you can take a screenshot and use a program like `Adobe Photoshop` or `Paint.net` to see them.
